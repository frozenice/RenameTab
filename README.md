# RenameTab package for Sublime Text 2

Got many tabs that aren't saved files and have either 'untitled' or other useless stuff as a title?

Install this package via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) or manually and rename those tabs!

Press `Alt+W` to open the rename-panel for the currently active tab, or select *Rename Tab* from the tab's context menu.
